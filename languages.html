<div class="heading"><strong>Java</strong></div>
<p class="matter">
    Java is a high-level programming language originally developed by Sun Microsystems and released in 1995. Java runs on a variety of platforms, such as Windows, Mac OS, and the various versions of UNIX. This tutorial gives a complete understanding of Java. This reference will take you through simple and practical approaches while learning Java Programming language.
    The latest release of the Java Standard Edition is Java SE 8. With the advancement of Java and its widespread popularity, multiple configurations were built to suit various types of platforms. For example: J2EE for Enterprise Applications, J2ME for Mobile Applications.

<div class="heading"><strong>Python</strong></div>
<p class="matter">
    Python is a general-purpose interpreted, interactive, object-oriented, and high-level programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum during 1985- 1990. Like Perl, Python source code is also available under the GNU General Public License (GPL). This tutorial gives enough understanding on Python programming language.

Why to Learn Python?
Python is a high-level, interpreted, interactive and object-oriented scripting language. Python is designed to be highly readable. It uses English keywords frequently where as other languages use punctuation, and it has fewer syntactical constructions than other languages.

<div class="heading"><strong>Eralng</strong></div>
<p class="matter">
    Erlang is a general purpose or you might say a functional programming language and runtime environment. It was built in such a way that it had inherent support for concurrency, distribution and fault tolerance. Erlang was originally developed to be used in several large telecommunication systems. But it has now slowly made its foray into diverse sectors like ecommerce, computer telephony and banking sectors as well.
    The first version of Erlang was developed by Joe Armstrong, Robert Virding and Mike Williams in 1986. It was originally a proprietary language within Ericsson. It was later released as an open source language in year 1998.

    <div class="heading"><strong>Rust</strong></div>
    <p class="matter">
        Rust is a modern systems programming language developed by the Mozilla Corporation. It is intended to be a language for highly concurrent and highly secure systems. It compiles to native code; hence, it is blazingly fast like C and C++. This tutorial adopts a simple and practical approach to describe the concepts of Rust programming.
        Application programming languages like Java/C# are used to build software, which provide services to the user directly. They help us build business applications like spreadsheets, word processors, web applications or mobile applications.

        Systems programming languages like C/C++ are used to build software and software platforms. They can be used to build operating systems, game engines, compilers, etc. These programming languages require a great degree of hardware interaction.

    <div class="heading"><strong>Swift</strong></div>
    <p class="matter">
        Swift 4 is a new programming language developed by Apple Inc for iOS and OS X development. Swift 4 adopts the best of C and Objective-C, without the constraints of C compatibility. Swift 4 uses the same runtime as the existing Obj-C system on Mac OS and iOS, which enables Swift 4 programs to run on many existing iOS 6 and OS X 10.8 platforms.
        This tutorial is designed for software programmers who would like to learn the basics of Swift 4 programming language from scratch. This tutorial will give you enough understanding on Swift 4 programming language from where you can take yourself to higher levels of expertise.
        Before proceeding with this tutorial, you should have a basic understanding of Computer Programming terminologies and exposure to any programming language.
